# Tips for New Pilots

**Stabilize mode** is recommended for the first flight. This is because the throttle is linear, which results in lower sensitivity.

After becoming more familiar with **Stabilize mode**, maintain the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) at an altitude above 1 m and try more advanced modes, such as **ALT Hold** or **Loiter**. Keep in mind the following as the control logic for these more advanced modes differ from **Stabilize** **mode**:

* Releasing the throttle stick will maintain the UAV's current altitude.
* Pushing the throttle up will cause the vehicle to climb while pushing it down will make it descend.

The UAV is not a toy and could cause injury if not properly controlled. Ensure there are no people or obstacles within 50m when operating the UAV.

It is important to understand the features and capabilities of the various flight modes before using them.&#x20;
