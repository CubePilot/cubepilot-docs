### 3. How do I Resolve the Driver Installation Issues for the Dual USB endpoint Cube Modules on a Windows 7 GCS?

Excluding the **Cube Black** and <mark style="color:purple;">**Cube Purple,**</mark> some issues could occur when installing drivers for dual USB endpoint Cube modules on a Windows 7 GCS. Using the <mark style="color:orange;">**Cube Orange**</mark> as an example, see below on how to resolve the problem:

1. Connect The Cube to the GCS.&#x20;
2. Open **Device Manager**.
3. Delete "CubePilot CUBE H7/F7" and then disconnect The Cube from the GCS.
4. Uninstall and reinstall the latest Cube drivers. The drivers can be downloaded from the following link: [https://firmware.ardupilot.org/Tools/MissionPlanner/](https://firmware.ardupilot.org/Tools/MissionPlanner/)
5. Reconnect the Cube to the GCS. The cube should appear as "CubeOrange-BL" in **Other Devices**.
6. Verify if the top entry changes to Cube and that Windows notifies you it is currently installing the device drivers.
7. Verify that "CubeOrange-BL" moves to **Ports** and is renamed as "Cube Orange Mavlink (COMx)".
8. If “CubeOrange-BL” does not move from **Other Devices** to **Ports,** right-click the mouse and go to **Properties**.&#x20;
9. Click the driver icon in **Properties** and verify if the driver has moved to **Ports** and is named "Cube Orange SLCAN (COMx)".&#x20;
