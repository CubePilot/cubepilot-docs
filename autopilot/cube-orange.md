#### Peripheral Ports <a id="peripheral-ports"></a>

Cube Orange is connected with Standard Carrier Board through a single 80 pin DF17 connector. Peripherals are connected via the carrier board.

#### Cube Orange Standard Carrier Board <a id="cube-orange-standard-carrier-board"></a>

The Standard Carrier Board features separate connectors for each external ports \(with a few shares the same port\).

| Connectors | Ports | Bus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `TELEM 1` | Serial 1 | UART 1 |
| `TELEM 2` | Serial 2 | UART 2 |
| `GPS 1` | Serial 3 | UART 3 / I2C 2 |
| `GPS 2` | Serial 4 | UART 4 / I2C 1 |
| `CONS` | Serial 5 | UART 5 |
| `I2C 2` | I2C 2 | I2C 2 |

* 5 serial ports are provided. **Serial 1** **\(`TELEM 1`\)** and **Serial 2 \(`TELEM 2`\)** feature full hardware flow control. **Serial 3 \(`GPS 1`\)** is recommended as for the GPS port because it provides the safety button \(with safety LED\) as well as I2C\(`I2C 1`\) for the compass and RGB LED. **Serial 4** **\(`GPS 2`\)** has I2C port also, but on the second bus \(I2C 2\). This allows connecting 2 compass modules at the same time. \(I2C 2 bus in Serial 4 Port is the same with I2C 2 bus in Port `I2C 2`\) **Serial 5 \(`CONS`\)** supports 3.3 V - 5 V CMOS logic level. It is buffered and ESD-protected.
* **I2C** **port** drive directly with no buffer. Its diver is built-in on the FMU. It supports up to 3.3 V. Serial 3 \(GPS1\) contain I2C 1 bus; I2C 2 and Serial4 \(GPS 2\) Port contain the same I2C 2 bus.
* **SPI port** has no buffer. It should only be used with short cable connection. Signals are 3.3 V - 5 V CMOS logic level. SPI is only available for test points on the Standard Carrier Board, along with a CS and INT pin.
* Analogue 1-3\*\* **ports** are protected against inputs up to 12 V, but scaled for 0 - 3.3 V inputs.
* **RSSI input** supports either PWM or analogue RSSI. This input shares a pin with S.Bus output, and only one may be connected at a time.
* CPPM and S.Bus input can be connected to **`RCIN`** port. Spektrum DSM Signal Input port is **`SKPT`**.
* **CAN ports** `CAN 1` and `CAN 2` are standard CAN bus. One end of the bus is connected to FMU main board. Drivers are FMU on-board.
* **Piezo port** **\(`ADC`\)** will drive most of the piezo elements in range of 5 - 300 nF. The maximum voltage of the port is 3.3 V.

#### Sensors <a id="sensors-1"></a>

All flight sensors in Cube Orange are connected via SPI. On-board we have a ICM20649 \(Accelerometer + Gyroscope\) and a MS5611 \(Barometer\).

On the vibration isolated board we have the ICM20948 \(Accelerometer + Gyroscope + Magnetometer\), another ICM20602 \(Accelerometer + Gyroscope\), and MS5611 \(Barometer\) are also used in SPI mode.

Sensors on FMU Main Board and Vibration Isolated Board run on a separated bus respectively. Data-ready signals from all sensors are NOT ROUTED.

### Power Architecture <a id="power-architecture"></a>

Cube Orange separates the power management module from FMU. The servo rail is not considered as the primary backup power source of for the FMU. Instead, power from servo rail is reserved for the IO as a final failsafe. 3.3 V power will be distributed to FMU and I/O.

* Split digital and analogue power domains for FMU and sensors.
* Backup power for IO in case of FMU failure.

![](../.gitbook/assets/system-power-distribution%20%281%29.svg)

#### Power Management Module \(separated from the FMU\) <a id="power-management-module-separated-from-the-fmu"></a>

Key features of power architecture of Cube Orange:

* Single, independent 5 V supply for the flight controller and peripherals.
* Allow power supply from Integration of 2 power bricks or compatible alternative, while current and voltage sensing is possible.
* Low power consumption and heat dissipation.
* Power distribution and monitoring for peripheral devices.
* Protection against common wiring faults, under/over-voltage protection, over-current protection, and thermal protection.
* Brownout detection and resilience.

#### FMU and I/O Power Distribution <a id="fmu-and-io-power-distribution"></a>

Both FMU and IO operate at 3.3 V, and each has its own private dual-channel voltage regulator. Each regulator features a power-on reset output tied to the regulator’s internal power-up and drop-out sequencing.

In most cases, FMU should be powered via the power brick or a compatible off board regulator via the power port or auxiliary power rail \(USB power input\). In desktop testing scenarios, taking power from USB avoids the need for a BEC or similar servo power source \(though servos themselves will still need external power\).

Other than power module, I/O will also accept power from the servo rail up to 10.5 V. Cube Orange supports both standard \(5 V\) and high-voltage \(up to 10 V\) servo power with some restrictions. This allows I/O to failover and switch to servo power in all cases if the main power supply is lost or interrupted.

#### Power Sources <a id="power-sources"></a>

Power can be supplied to Cube Orange via USB, power 1 port, or power 2 port. Each power connector is protected against reverse-polarity connections and back-powering from other sources. The FMU + I/O power is expected to be 250 mA, including all LEDs and the Piezo buzzer. Peripheral power is limited to 2.5 A in total.

#### POWER 1 Power Module Input Port <a id="power-1-power-module-input-port"></a>

The power port is the preferred power source for Cube Orange. It will always be selected if it is available.

#### POWER 2 Aux Power Module Input Port <a id="power-2-aux-power-module-input-port"></a>

Cube Orange introduces a backup power port. The connector is same as the primary power input. When Aux power module is connected to the system, Cube Orange and peripherals combined may draw up to 2.75 A in total as long as the power module can support the required current for the load. If the input voltage exceed 5.7 V, power from that input will be ignored.

> Noted: Cube Orange will not power the servos.

#### Servo Power <a id="servo-power"></a>

Other than power module, the I/O chip can take power up to 10.5 V from the servo rail. This is used to provide power for manual mode when both of the the other two main power sources failed. Controller will get the control when the auto-pilot system failed. This is only useful for plane, and only if the I/O chip has been mapped correctly.

> Noted: FMU and peripherals will NOT accept power from the servo rail.

#### USB Power Input <a id="usb-power-input"></a>

Power from USB is supported for software update, testing and development purposes. USB power is supplied to the peripheral ports for testing purposes. However total current consumption is typically limited to 500 mA, including peripherals in order to avoid overloading the host USB port.

#### Multiple Power Sources <a id="multiple-power-sources"></a>

When more than 1 power source is connected, power will be drawn from the highest-priority source with a valid input voltage. \(Priority as shown in the table below\)

For example: When high priority is malfunctioned, system will use lower priority power source to maintain work. When higher priority is functional again, system will immediately switch back to higher priority power source. When the power input is out of the limit but within the protection range, this power source will not input any power \(cannot support for system operation\). Hence, system will not be damaged.

| Power Sources | Priority | Regular range | Limit | Protection Range |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| POWER 1 | High \(Main\) | 4.8 V - 5.4 V | 4.1 V - 5.7 V | 0 V - 20 V |
| POWER 2 | High \(Auxiliary\) | 4.8 V - 5.4 V | 4.1 V - 5.7 V | 0 V - 20 V |
| SERVO | Medium \(Emergency\) | 4.8 V - 5.4 V | 4.1 V - 10.5 V | 0 V - 20 V |
| USB | Low \(Optional\) | 4.8 V - 5.4 V | 4.1 V - 5.7 V | 0 V - 6 V |

> I/O will accept power from the servo connector up to 10 V FOR MANUAL OVERRIDE. This allows I/O to failover to servo power in all cases if the main power supply is lost or interrupted. System will be UNPOWERED WHEN SERVO INPUT IS ABOVE 5.7 V AND POWER MODULE INPUT IS ABSENT. FMU and peripherals will NOT accept power from the servo rail.

For each of the components listed, the ranges of input voltage over which the device can be powered from each input is shown below.

| Power Sources | FMU | I/O | Peripherals |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| POWER 1 | 4 - 5.7 V | 4 - 5.7 V | 4 - 5.7 V，2.5 A \(MAX\) |
| POWER 2 | 4 - 5.7 V | 4 - 5.7 V | 4 - 5.7 V，2.5 A \(MAX\) |
| SERVO | NIL | 4 - 10.5 V | NIL |
| USB | 4 - 5.7 V | 4 - 5.7 V | 4 - 5.7 V，250 mA \(MAX\) |

#### Peripherals <a id="peripherals"></a>

**Peripheral Power**

Cube Orange provides power routing, over/under voltage detection and protection, current-limiting and transient suppression for peripherals. Power outputs to peripherals feature ESD and EMI filtering, and the power supply protection scheme ensures that no more than 5.5 V is presented to peripheral devices. Power supply will be disconnected from the peripherals when the available supply voltage falls below 2.7 V or rises above 5.7 V.

Peripheral power is split into two groups, each of them are software controlled:

1. **Serial 1\(`TELEM 1`\)** has a independent 1.5 A current limit with peak not more than 2A. The limitation should be sufficient for a 30 dBm transmitter of reasonable efficiency. This output is EMI filtered and its power is drawn directly from the USB / power module input.
2. All other peripherals share a 1 A current limit and a single power switch. Peak current being drawn from this port should not exceed 1.5 A

The Spektrum / DSM R/C interface \(**`SKTM`** port\) draws power from its own power regulator, enabled by the software. Spektrum receivers generally draw ~25 mA from `SKTM` port. S.Bus and CPPM receivers can be powered directly from the servo rail, and support supply voltage from servo.

**Backup Battery**

Both the FMU and IO micro-controllers feature battery-backed real-time clocks and SRAM. The on-board backup battery has sufficient capacity for the clock and SRAM, which is used to avoid data loss due to temporal power lost and ensure that system can be recovered after regaining power \(corresponding software may be needed for the recovery function\). The backup battery is recharged from the FMU 3.3 V rail on the Carrier board.

**Voltage, Current and Fault Sensing**

The battery voltage and current reported by both power module can be measured by the FMU. In addition, the 5V unregulated supply rail can also be measured \(to detect brownout conditions\). IO can measure the servo power rail voltage. Over-current conditions on the peripheral power ports can be detected by the FMU. Hardware lock-out prevents damage due to persistent short-circuits on these ports. The lockout can be reset by FMU software. The under/over voltage monitor on FMU provides an output that is used to hold FMU in reset during brown-out events.

**EMI Filtering and Transient Protection \(On Carrier Board\)**

EMI filtering is deployed at key points in the system by high-insertion-loss pass through filters. These filters are paired with TVS diodes at the peripheral connectors to suppress power transients.

Reverse polarity protection is provided at every power inputs.

USB signals are filtered and interrupted with a combined termination/TVS array.

Most digital peripheral signals \(all PWM outputs, serial ports, I2C port\) are driven by ESD-enhanced buffers and specialized serial blocking resistors to reduce the risk of damage from transients or accidental short-circuits.
