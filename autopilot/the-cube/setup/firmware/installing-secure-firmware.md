# Installing Secure Firmware

Securing firmware involves signing both the bootloader and firmware using the ECC Prime256v1 keypair. The keypairâ€™s private key is securely generated and stored on CubePilot's server. Once a signed bootloader is installed, only firmware signed with an authorized public-private key pair can run on the autopilot. Any unsigned firmware will be blocked from being loaded.

To install the secure bootloader, complete the following steps:

1. Ensure the ArduPilot firmware build environment is installed using Linux or Windows WSL. For details, refer to the following website: [https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/building-the-code.html](https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/building-the-code.html#building-the-code)
2. Ensure the latest MAVProxy has been installed. For details, refer to the following website: [https://ardupilot.org/mavproxy/docs/getting\_started/download\_and\_installation.html#mavproxy-downloadinstall](https://ardupilot.org/mavproxy/docs/getting_started/download_and_installation.html#mavproxy-downloadinstall)
3. Create a branch to develop the firmware locally.
4. Open Mission Planner.
5. Click **Setup** -> **Secure**.
6. Click **Generate Key** to create a public-private key pair.

9. Use MAVProxy to flash the securely signed bootloader as the new bootloader.
10. Verify that the new secure bootloader has been installed.
