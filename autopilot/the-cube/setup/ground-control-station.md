# Ground Control Station

The following section explains how to select the appropriate ground control station (GCS) and use it to set up and monitor the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).

### Selecting the Appropriate Ground Control Station

A GCS is a software application that runs on a ground-based computer and communicates with the UAV via wireless telemetry. It provides real-time data on the UAV's performance and position and can serve as a “virtual cockpit” by displaying instruments similar to those in a real plane.&#x20;

Different GCS are available based on the UAV and working environment. They can be used to upload mission commands, obtain real-time data, monitor live video streams, plan a mission, calibrate the UAV, configure parameters, etc. The functions and user interface can vary.

Currently, the two most common GCS user interfaces are:

* **Mission Planner**: Suitable for ArduPilot firmware
* **QGroundControl**: Suitable for PX4 firmware

In this documentation, you will learn how to install Mission Planner and ArduPilot.&#x20;
