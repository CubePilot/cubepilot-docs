# Configure Modes & Mavlink Buttons

Herelink is fitted with six programmable buttons and one hardware wheel,these can be configured in Solex TX or QGC to preset mavlink commands such as mode selection,servo outputs and app control.

Buttons A,B,C,D,Cam, Home & HW Wheel can be configured in Solex TX and QGC to Mavlink commands, these include

* Mode Selection 
* Arm/Disarm 
* Servo Output Control 
* Relay Control 
* HW Wheel Channel Mapping
* App Specific Commands

There is a video overview of setting up Herelink and configuring buttons on the [Herelink Pairing, RC Calibration & Setup](one-time-setup.md) Page.

## Autopilot Mode Selection

Solet TX and QGC have on screen controls for selecting mode in Ardupilot and PX4, ie: selecting and changing flight modes such as loiter,stabilised. If you want to configure one or more buttons to change modes they must only be set to Mavlink button commands within Solex TX or QGC.

Mavlink provides a safe command link for mode change and is not affected by system reboots and loss of signal.

After configuring mode selection users should confirm their failsafe settings are correct and work as expected by testing before using the system.

**Important Note:** Ardupilot sets Sbus channel 5 to mode selection as default, this should be disabled with herelink by setting the pram FLTMODE\_CH: to 0.

## Home Button

The home button can only be configured with mavlink commands in Solex TX or QGC. It is advised to set Homebutton Long Press to ‘RTL’ command.
