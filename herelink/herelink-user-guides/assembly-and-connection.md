**1.** Mount the Rover Unit securely to the drone.(Choose best install position according to cable length)

**2.** Choose the best position to attach the rover unit antennas. Airunit antenna should no attached to metal parts or any conductorï¼Œwhich will affect the signal transmit distance. The antenna should be installed vertically and keep an Angle of about 15 degrees to obtain better gain.

Please refer to Figure 1 and Figure 2 below. (Note that carbon fiber is also conductive material.)

**3.** Connect **S.bus** on Airunit to the **RCIN** on the Flight Controller.

**4.** Connect **UART** on the Airunit to the **TELEM 1** or TELEM 2 on the Flight Controller.

**5.** Connect 5V - 12.6V max (3s Lipo supported) battery to the power input on the Rover Unit.

**6.** Connect camera to HDMI 1 (preferred) on the Airunit. If you are using two video stream,please connect the second camera to HDMI 2. You may switch from Stream 1 and Stream 2 on controller to display the corresponding video stream.
