## Overview

Herelink is a intigrated remote controler and wireless digital transmission system designed to be used with the Cube Autopilot, Ardupilot or PX4.  

Herelink allows RC contorl, HD video and mavlink telemetary data to be tranmitted upto 20km range. Both air unit and ground station included intigrated 8 core SOC for custom application developmeent.

## Features
* Android based smart device with 5.46 inch 1080P capacitive touch screen.
* ARM Cortex A53 4 core 2.2GHz + Cortex A53 4 core 1.4GHz SOC in both air and ground units. 
* Dual hall affect self centering gimbals with removalbe sticks. 
* Dual micro HDMI 1080P 60fps video inputs. 
* Dual S.bus signal output for simultaneous control of autopilot and pan/tilt cameras.
* Integrated digital transmission system simultaneously transmiting video,flight data and control. 
* Built-in Solex TX App and QGC ground station with mavlink support for Ardupilot and PX4 firmware.
* 6 customisable Mavlink buttons and Mavlink/Sbus hardware wheel. 
* RC gimbal control on dedicated service indipendant from APP.
