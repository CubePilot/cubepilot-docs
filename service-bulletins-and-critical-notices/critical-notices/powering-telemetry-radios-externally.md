# Powering Telemetry radios externally

The RFD900 Radio Modem is a high powered 900Mhz, ISM band radio modem designed for long range serial communication. Ranges of 15km and much higher have been reported.

**Warning**  
Many common flight controllers have telemetry port current limits that prevent directly powering RFD900 radios at their full transmit power. You should power high power radios externally.‚Äù
