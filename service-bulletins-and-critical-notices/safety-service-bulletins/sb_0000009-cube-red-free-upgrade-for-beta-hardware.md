Cube Red Beta hardware update. Do not Fly

To all that purchased a cube Red..

We will be doing a free upgrade to improve the hardware performance based on learning from users.

We will not require you to return your existing hardware, but rather, we ask that you assign it to desk duties, development, and other non moving vehicle related responsibilities. We know that it was supposed to be “non beta” but we feel these improvements are worthwhile and don’t want “two” versions of cube red in the market at this time.

This will roll out over the next couple of months, we appreciate all of you that take the jump on new hardware, and as such, we plan on adding a special feature to commemorate moving to Stable hardware.

New hardware will be distinguishable by a feature that we will announce in this chat soon.

Your reseller will contact you when your upgraded cube is ready.

There is nothing that you need to do yet.
