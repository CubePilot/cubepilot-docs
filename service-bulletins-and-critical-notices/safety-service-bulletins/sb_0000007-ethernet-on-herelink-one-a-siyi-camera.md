Attention all SIYI camera users, please DO NOT connect a SIYI camera to HereLink ethernet directly, you MUST use magnetics or capacitors to isolate or put a switch or hub in line.

We are unsure as to why, but it appears that the SIYI is destroying the HereLink ethernet port.

We are not blaming SIYI, it is simply that some hardware’s do not play well together, and sometimes need something in the middle to help…
