# France

With the arrival of the new European regulations, certain equipments will become mandatory. This results in France by the need to equip drones with a Wifi module which sends the position of the drone through the air (like a transponder)

In order to allow as many people as possible to have access to this device, [Kancir Pierre](https://www.facebook.com/kancir.pierre?fref=gs&\_\_tn\_\_=%2CdK-R-R\&eid=ARDfvINAtTIUZdJ2sacML6xqMtg1ozcRqCrYGTyQwq-DpDY2LjGOBx1A9nWRtfD0oZGod9PlXl1aC94a\&dti=376731732884680\&hc\_location=group) (ardupilot developper), supported by [Airbot Systems](https://www.facebook.com/airbot.systems/?ref=gs&\_\_tn\_\_=%2CdK-R-R\&eid=ARBeb-Ci7f623DBasMMtR9JqfwbdHdZ-UjMwejy7ZQLF4Y4y6ynUyL3nGQ\_BygunptdTC2W8lNerAKIP\&fref=gs\&dti=376731732884680\&hc\_location=group) , have produced software, enabling this device to be DIY manufactured at low cost.

All files are open source, under the GPL license. They contain the sources, the software part allowing to make the drone wifi beacon, a software allowing to make a drone detection system based on wifi frames, an example of code ready to be installed on a basic module sold on common commercial platforms for approx 35 Euros, and also 3D files to print a protection box by yourself. We hope it can helps others, regarding the regulation of their countries
