## **4.2.1 Pre-Flight Planning**

Do not use the Meadowhawk in adverse weather conditions including rain, snow, fog, and wind speeds exceeding 20 MPH.&#x20;

Only fly in open areas, tall buildings and steel structures may affect the accuracy of the compass and the GPS signal.

Avoid flying near obstacles, crowds, high voltage power lines, trees and bodies of water.

Aircraft and battery performance is subject to environmental factors such as air density and temperature. Be very careful when flying over 8,202 feet (2,500 meters) above sea level as the battery and aircraft performance may be reduced.

Check your surroundings and warn anyone in the immediate area of your operation.&#x20;

Create a NOTAM and alert the nearest airport, if applicable.

Create a flight plan and inform anyone else participating in the mission of your plan.

## **4.2.2 System Assembly and Pre-Flight Inspection**

To set up the Meadowhawk for flight, remove the aircraft from the case and set it on a flat, non-obstructive surface.

### **Pre-Flight Inspection**

**WARNING **

Propellers must be checked before each flight for nicks or cracks and installed securely.

**WARNING **

Ensure the propellers are installed in the correct orientation and are spinning the correct direction. Failure to install the correct propeller in the correct position and orientation will result in an aircraft crash.

## **4.2.3 Systems Start**

### **Powering On the Aircraft**

Place the aircraft in an open area with clear visibility of the sky and a level service. Insert the battery pack into the rear of the Meadowhawk below the antennas. Push in firmly, pulling down on the locking tab if needed. Make sure the battery is fully inserted by attempting to remove the battery without using the battery locking latch. It should remain firmly in place. Leave the aircraft powered on for two to three minutes before launching. This will give the GPS ample time to lock position on multiple GPS satellites.

### **Powering On the Radio Controller**

Press and hold the Power button on the radio controller, the radio controller system will boot up.

### **Connecting the Radio Controller to the Aircraft**

If the Radio Controller and Aircraft link does not automatically connect, press the CONNECT button on the left hand side of the display screen.

### **Flight Screen**

To view the flight screen, click on the Union Robotics logo at the bottom left side of the screen.

### **Pre-Flight Checklist Screen**

This will take you to the “Pre-Flight Checklist” screen, where you are required to check each item.

**WARNING**

Physically inspect the aircraft for each item on the Pre-Flight Checklist before checking the box on the screen. Failure to do so could result in aircraft failure or injury.

![](<../../../../../../.gitbook/assets/Pre-Flight Checklist Screen.png>)

### **Verify Controls Screen**

Once all items have been checked on the Pre-Flight Checklist screen, you will be automatically directed to the Verify Controls screen. This screen reminds the pilot to verify all the aircraft controls properly function upon take off before starting the mission. Click “GO” to be directed to the flight screen.

### **Arming the Meadowhawk**

Hold down the left Throttle stick while pressing the Arm button on the ground station display screen on the left hand side, located in the Controls menu.

## **4.2.4 Take-Off | Launch Systems**

To take off, move the throttle vertically in the upward direction. Be sure to provide ample throttle to get the Meadowhawk off the ground.

![](../../../../../../.gitbook/assets/Herelink-throttle.png)

## **4.2.5 Flight Modes**

### **Loiter**

In Loiter, the Meadowhawk will maintain its position over a given point on the ground and correct for disturbances. Loiter Mode requires a strong GPS signal and communication with a minimum of 6 satellites. If a weak signal is present, the Meadowhawk will not enter Loiter Mode.

### **Return-to-Launch (RTL)**

Return-to-Launch Mode will command the Meadowhawk to fly back to the defined launch point. When the Meadowhawk first acquires a GPS position, it sets this as the launch point of the flight. Return-to-launch Mode enables the aircraft to follow a straight path when returning to the initial launch point.

During an LOS event, RTL followed by auto-land will be initiated automatically. The Meadowhawk will first check its current altitude against the configured RTL altitude. The Meadowhawk will climb to Safe-Height. Next, the Meadowhawk will fly back to the launch position set at the initial GPS position.  If the Meadowhawk is below 45ft. then it will climb to 45ft. if above 45 ft. then it will return to launch at its current altitude.&#x20;

### **Smart Return-to-Launch (SmartRTL)**

When switched into Smart RTL, like regular RTL, the vehicle will attempt to return home. The “Smart” part of this mode is that it will retrace a safe path home instead of returning directly home. This can be useful if there are obstacles between the vehicle and the home position.

### **Land Now**

Land Now will initiate the auto-land function, which will land the aircraft in the current place. The vertical speed at which the Meadowhawk will descend during an auto-land varies as the Meadowhawk approaches the ground. By default, the aircraft will descend at 1m/s until 10 Ft above the ground and then it will slow its descent considerably until touchdown.

## **4.2.6 In-Flight Monitoring**

### **Ground Station Software Overview and Telemetry Display**

The telemetry display is located on the ground station radio controller. The pilot should always be aware of all information on the display.
