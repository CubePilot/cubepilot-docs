## **4.2.1 Pre-Flight Planning**

Do not use the Meadowhawk in adverse weather conditions including rain, snow, fog, and wind speeds exceeding 20 MPH.&#x20;

Only fly in open areas, tall buildings and steel structures may affect the accuracy of the compass and the GPS signal.

Avoid flying near obstacles, crowds, high voltage power lines, trees and bodies of water.

Aircraft and battery performance is subject to environmental factors such as air density and temperature. Be very careful when flying over 8,202 feet (2,500 meters) above sea level as the battery and aircraft performance may be reduced.

Check your surroundings and warn anyone in the immediate area of your operation.&#x20;

Create a NOTAM and alert the nearest airport, if applicable.

Create a flight plan and inform anyone else participating in the mission of your plan.

## **4.2.2 System Assembly and Pre-Flight Inspection**

To set up the Meadowhawk for flight, remove the aircraft from the case and set it on a flat, non-obstructive surface.
