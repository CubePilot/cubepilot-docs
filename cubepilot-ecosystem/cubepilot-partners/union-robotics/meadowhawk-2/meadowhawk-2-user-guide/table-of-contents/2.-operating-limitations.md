# 2. OPERATING LIMITATIONS

## **2.1 Introduction**

This Section includes operating limitations which are necessary for the safe operation of the Meadowhawk, motors, standard equipment and standard payload.

**WARNING**

All limitations given in this Section must be complied for all operations.

**NOTE**

Refer to the Supplements, Section 9 of this Remote Vehicle Flight Manual for amended Operating Limitations, Operating Procedures, Performance Data and other necessary information for the Meadowhawk equipped with specific equipment or payload.

## **2.2 Airspeed Limitations**

|                                   |        |
| --------------------------------- | ------ |
| Stall Speed                       | N/A    |
| Operating Maneuvering Speed       | 22 MPH |
| Maximum Structural Cruising Speed | 30 MPH |
| Never Exceed Speed                | 38 MPH |

**NOTE**

Flight speeds and flight envelope are limited by flight controller factory settings. Wind speeds may affect these values.

## **2.3 Mass | Centre of Gravity Limits**

|                                                                          |                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| Empty Weight - Without Flight Battery or Payload                         | 4 lbs / 1.8 KG  |
| Nominal Take-Off Weight - with Standard Flight Battery, Standard Payload | 7 lbs / 3.1 KG  |
| Maximum Take-Off Weight                                                  | 10 lbs / 4.5 KG |

**WARNING**

Exceeding weight limitations may lead to overloading of the Meadowhawk structure and cause loss of control of the Meadowhawk and/or structural damage.

The reference datum for determining the longitudinal Centre of Gravity is located below; given the lateral symmetry of the Meadowhawk, the reference line for the lateral Centre of Gravity is located on the symmetry axis.

**WARNING **

Exceeding the centre of gravity limitations reduces the maneuverability and stability of the Meadowhawk.

**NOTE**

The values are based on simulations and are verified during D\&R
