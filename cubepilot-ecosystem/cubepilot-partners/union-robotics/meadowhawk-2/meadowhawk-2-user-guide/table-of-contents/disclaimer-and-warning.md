* Meadowhawk is not a toy and should be operated with extreme care, as improper operation can cause damage to property, serious personal injury or death.
* As with any multi-rotor aircraft, Meadowhawk is a complex and technical machine. Novice pilots should invest sufficient time on a flight simulator and seek training from an experienced pilot prior to operation. The Meadowhawk Aircraft Flight Manual and a flight simulator are no substitute for training with an experienced pilot, particularly when it comes to learning how to safely operate the Meadowhawk. Novice pilots should never fly without the supervision of an experienced pilot.
* Always check the Meadowhawk and its components prior to operation.
* Ensure that all parts are in good condition before each flight. DO NOT fly with worn or damaged parts.
* Always maintain a safe distance from the Meadowhawk when in use.
* Never attempt to touch the Meadowhawk when the propellers are moving.
* Ensure that the propellers are installed correctly before each flight.
* When testing the motor direction, always test the Meadowhawk with the propellers removed.
* Maintain a safe distance from people, buildings, high voltage power lines, tall trees, water, and other hazards when flying the aircraft.
* Never fly with any propellers that have visible imperfections or damage.
* Always keep children and animals a safe distance away from the Meadowhawk when in use and when changing configurations.
* Only use compatible Union Robotics® parts.
* Always remove the propellers when making a change to the configuration of the Meadowhawk to prevent propeller strikes in the event of unintentional motor starts.
* It is your responsibility to perform a full system check of the Meadowhawk prior to every flight.
* It is your responsibility to learn how to safely operate the Meadowhawk and to adhere to all applicable rules and regulations.
* Fly at your own risk.

* Ensure that all cables are connected correctly and firmly before each flight.
* Only use Union Robotics® Flight Batteries as the power supply.
* DO NOT overload the system.
