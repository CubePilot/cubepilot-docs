# 1. GENERAL

## ** 1.1 Introduction**

This Remote Vehicle Flight Manual has been prepared to describe the complete operation of the airframe and flight control systems of the Meadowhawk remotely piloted aerial vehicle, and the normal maintenance of those items. Do not operate the Meadowhawk without reading and understanding this manual.\


This manual is not a substitute for adequate flight training. Training requirements can vary when operating in different countries or under different flight conditions. Always consult local regulations before flying the Meadowhawk. In areas where there are no flight training requirements, it is the sole determination of the pilot-in-command as to whether he or she has the appropriate level of training or experience for a given flight. Always set and adhere to personal minimums and fly within your own capabilities.\


## **1.2 Warnings, Cautions and Notes**
