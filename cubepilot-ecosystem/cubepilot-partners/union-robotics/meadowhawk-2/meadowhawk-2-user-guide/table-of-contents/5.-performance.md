# 5. PERFORMANCE

## **5.1 Introduction**

The performance data in this section has been prepared to illustrate the performance you may expect from the Meadowhawk under various conditions and to facilitate the planning of flights in detail and with reasonable accuracy.

The performance data do not take into account the expertise of the sUAS pilot or the maintenance condition of the sUAS. The performance described can be achieved if the indicated procedures are followed and the sUAS is maintained in good condition.

## **5.2.1 Take-Off Area (Distance)**

**WARNING**

Use caution when operating the Meadowhawk around people, vehicles, trees and other obstructions. Only fly near or above crowds, airports or buildings with appropriate authorization.

![](../../../../../../.gitbook/assets/takeoffzone.png)

Never attempt to operate the Meadowhawk nearby tall buildings/obstructions that do not offer a clear view of the sky (a minimum clearance of 100Â°).

Be sure to place the Meadowhawk on a level and stable surface before powering ON the Ground Station and the aircraft.

**NOTICE**

&#x20;Step back approximately 26 feet (8 meters) behind the Meadowhawk.
