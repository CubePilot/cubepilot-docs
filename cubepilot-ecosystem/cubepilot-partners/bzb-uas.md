### **ekoSKY**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ekosky.png)

This plane is equipped with a vertical takeoff and landing system \(VTOL\). It is made of composite materials and is powered only by electric motors. Takeoff and landing procedure is performed using four reliable vertical takeoff engines. After reaching the transition height, the front motor is started. This motor allows the plane to stay in the air for up to 240 minutes. Plug&Play system, vertical takeoff and landing make flight preparation and operation surprisingly simple and convenient.

Integrated electronics adapted to connect the cube autopilot and the telemetry radio from RFDesign. The system is dedicated to QuadPlane, Tilt Motor, or Fixed wing Plane UAVs. Minimize the number of wired connections.

Integrated with the converter to supply 5V servos. Separate, redundant autopilot power supply, significantly increases the reliability of the system.
