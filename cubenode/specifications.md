# Specifications

The CubeNode provides a platform to develop, create, test, and refine components such as navigation systems, communication modules, sensors, payloads, and more.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Depending on the CubeNode version, some features may be unavailable.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The CubeNode should undergo reflow soldering only once. For a two-sided assembly, ensure the device is soldered during the second pass through the line. If it is unable to run through the second pass, use reflow-safe underfill. Failure to comply may result in permanent damage to the device. &#x20;
{% endhint %}
